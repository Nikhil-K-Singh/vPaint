# vPaint

### We will be creating a virtual paint system to generate drawings in the air.

#### the system uses OpenCV as the primary module for the task.


- Opens yor default camera
- Detects objects with the preset color (can be changed // added  )
- Draws circles at the center of spotted object
- Consecutive circles are retained on the screen, thereby creating lines.
